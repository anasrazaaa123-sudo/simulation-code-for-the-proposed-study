This script computes degree-based topological indices used in the associated research paper.

This script calculates topological entropy measures based on computed topological indices.
MATLAB Implementation Details

MATLAB was used exclusively for regression analysis and graphical visualization.

Workflow
- The datasets obtained from Python-based topological indices and entropy calculations
  were imported directly into MATLAB during runtime.
- No external MATLAB scripts were written or stored.
- MATLAB built-in applications were used for analysis.

Regression Analysis
- Regression models were obtained using MATLAB's built-in Curve Fitting App.
- All regression fitting was performed interactively through the GUI.
- No custom regression code was implemented.

Graph Generation
- All plots and figures were generated directly from the Curve Fitting App.
- The resulting figures were exported and included in the manuscript.

Note
Due to the use of MATLAB built-in applications and runtime data import,
no standalone MATLAB source files are available.
